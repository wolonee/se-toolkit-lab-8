## About the VM access

VM access is the process of connecting to a [virtual machine](./vm.md#what-is-a-vm) over a network using [`SSH`](./ssh.md#what-is-ssh).

The initial connection uses [the user `root`](./linux.md#the-user-root) because a fresh VM has no other [users](./operating-system.md#user).
After that, you create [a non-root user](./linux.md#a-non-root-user) and switch to it for all further work.

Working as [the user `root`](./linux.md#the-user-root) is risky because every command runs with full [permissions](./linux.md#permissions) — a mistake or a compromised session can modify or delete any [file](./file-system.md#file), change system configuration, or break the [operating system](./operating-system.md#what-is-an-operating-system).
A non-root user operates with limited permissions by default, so accidental damage is contained.
When an administrative action is genuinely needed, the user can escalate temporarily with the [`sudo` command](./linux-administration.md#the-sudo-command).

After switching to the non-root user, you [restrict the `SSH` connection](#restrict-the-ssh-connection) so that [the user `root`](./linux.md#the-user-root) can no longer log in remotely.
This reduces the attack surface of the VM: even if an attacker knows the IP address, the most powerful account is unreachable over the network.

## Set up the `SSH` access to the VM

> [!NOTE]
> Replace the placeholder [`<user>`](./operating-system.md#user-placeholder).

Complete these steps:

<!-- no toc -->
1. [Set up `SSH` (LOCAL)](#set-up-ssh-local).
2. [Create a VM](./vm.md#create-a-vm).
3. [Check that the VM is accessible (LOCAL)](./vm-access.md#check-the-vm-is-accessible-local).
4. [Set up the `SSH` access to the VM as the user `root`](#set-up-the-ssh-access-to-the-vm-as-the-user-root).
5. [Set up the `SSH` access to the VM as the user `<user>`](#set-up-the-ssh-access-to-the-vm-as-the-user-user).
6. [Restrict the `SSH` connection](#restrict-the-ssh-connection).

## Set up `SSH` (LOCAL)

Set up [`SSH`](./ssh.md#what-is-ssh) to connect to a [remote host](./computer-networks.md#remote-host).

Complete these steps:

<!-- no toc -->
1. [Check your current shell](./vs-code.md#check-the-current-shell-in-the-vs-code-terminal).
2. [Create a new `SSH` key (LOCAL)](#create-a-new-ssh-key-local).
3. [Find the `SSH` key files (LOCAL)](#find-the-ssh-key-files-local).
4. [Get the `SSH` public key (LOCAL)](#get-the-ssh-public-key-local).
5. [Add the `SSH` key to the `ssh-agent` (LOCAL)](#add-the-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent-local).

### Create a new `SSH` key (LOCAL)

1. To generate a new key,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "se-toolkit-student" -f ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key
   ```

   *Note:* You can replace `"se-toolkit-student"` with your email or another label.

   *Note:* `-f ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key` sets a custom file path and name.

   > Note
   > We'll use the `ed25519` algorithm, which is the modern standard for security and performance.
   > We chose this algorithm because it's used in the [`GitHub` docs on generating a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key).

   > Note
   > Actually, you generate a key pair: a **private key** (secret) and a **public key** (safe to share).

2. **Passphrase:** When prompted `Enter passphrase`, you may type a secure password or press `Enter` for no passphrase.

   *Note:* If you set a passphrase, use `ssh-agent` to avoid retyping it on every connection.

### Find the `SSH` key files (LOCAL)

1. To verify the keys were created,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   ls ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key*
   ```

2. You should see two files listed.

   The file ending in `.pub` contains the [public key](./ssh.md#ssh-public-key).

   Another file contains the [private key](./ssh.md#ssh-private-key).

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Never share the private key.

### Get the `SSH` public key (LOCAL)

1. To view the content of the public key file,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   cat ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key.pub
   ```

   The output should be similar to this:

   ```terminal
   ssh-ed25519 AKdk38D3faWJnlFfalFJSKEFGG/vmLQ62Z+vpWCe5e/c2n37cnNc39N3c8qb7cBS+e3d se-toolkit-student
   ```

### Add the `SSH` key to the `ssh-agent` (LOCAL)

1. To start the agent,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

2. To add the key to the `ssh-agent`,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key
   ```

3. To list the loaded keys,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   ssh-add -l
   ```

   You should see your key fingerprint in the output.

>
> **`The agent has no identities`.**
>
> [Add the `SSH` key to the `ssh-agent` (LOCAL)](#add-the-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent-local) again.

### Check the VM is accessible (LOCAL)

1. [Connect to the correct network](./vm.md#connect-to-the-correct-network).

2. [Get the IP address of the VM](./vm.md#get-the-ip-address-of-the-vm).

3. To check that the VM is accessible,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   ping <your-vm-ip-address>
   ```

   You should see the output like this:

   ```terminal
   PING <your-vm-ip-address> (<your-vm-ip-address>) 56(84) bytes of data.
   64 bytes from <your-vm-ip-address>: icmp_seq=1 ttl=62 time=4.40 ms
   64 bytes from <your-vm-ip-address>: icmp_seq=2 ttl=62 time=5.34 ms
   64 bytes from <your-vm-ip-address>: icmp_seq=3 ttl=62 time=3.04 ms
   ...
   ```

   The lines should continue being printed.

   > 1. [Recreate the VM](./vm.md#recreate-the-vm)

## Set up the `SSH` access to the VM as the user `root`

Complete these steps:

1. [Update the `SSH` config to connect to the VM as the user `root` (LOCAL)](#update-the-ssh-config-to-connect-to-the-vm-as-the-user-root-local).
2. [Connect to the VM as the user `root` (LOCAL)](#connect-to-the-vm-as-the-user-root-local).

### Update the `SSH` config to connect to the VM as the user `root` (LOCAL)

1. [Open the file using `code`](./vs-code.md#open-the-file-or-the-directory-using-code):
   `~/.ssh/config`.

2. Add this text at the end of the opened file:

   - `Linux`, `Windows` (`WSL`):

     ```text
     Host se-toolkit-vm
        HostName <your-vm-ip-address>
        User root
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key
        AddKeysToAgent yes
     ```

   - `macOS`:

     ```text
     Host se-toolkit-vm
        HostName <your-vm-ip-address>
        User root
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/se_toolkit_key
        AddKeysToAgent yes
        UseKeychain yes
     ```

   Replace the placeholder [`<your-vm-ip-address>`](./vm.md#your-vm-ip-address-placeholder).

   > 🟩 **Tip**
   >
   > If `~/.ssh/config` already contains a `Host se-toolkit-vm` entry, skip this step.

### Connect to the VM as the user `root` (LOCAL)

1. [Connect to the correct network](./vm.md#connect-to-the-correct-network).

   If it prints errors, fix them in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` before continuing.

3. To restart `sshd`,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

   The output should be empty.

### Verify that you can't connect to the VM as the user `root` (LOCAL)

1. [Open a new `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#open-a-new-vs-code-terminal).

2. To try to connect to the VM as the user `root`,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](./vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   ssh root@<your-vm-ip-address>
   ```

   Replace the placeholder [`<your-vm-ip-address>`](./vm.md#your-vm-ip-address-placeholder).

   The output should be similar to this:

   ```terminal
   Received disconnect from <your-vm-ip-address> port 22:2: Too many authentication failures
   Disconnected from <your-vm-ip-address> port 22
   ```

<!-- 7. If you use the `ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh` extension in `VS Code`, the status bar should show that you are connected to a remote host.
